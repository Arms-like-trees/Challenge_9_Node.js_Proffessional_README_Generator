# Professional README generator

## Description

I was wanting to use the command-line application form the terminal to take in user input so that from the input a professional style README.md would be generated .  In the application it would ask questions in regards to title, description, and other aspects of a README.md ,then would take the data that was collected and put in the appropriate sections.  The biggest thing that I learned while working on this was how to utilize inquirer and the data gathered from it to be used I the file generation.

## Installation

In order to run this project you will need to run '< npm i>' in the command line to install the node modules.  After that you type in '< node index.js>' to run application.  Afterwords your document will be created.

## Usage
